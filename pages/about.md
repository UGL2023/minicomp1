***The Berbice Campus Library***

The University of Guyana Berbice Campus Library (UGBCL) is a Branch of the main University Library at Turkeyen. The Berbice Campus Library (BCL) is headed by a Deputy University Librarian, who reports to the University Librarian at Turkeyen.

One of our main objectives is to support the instructional, information and research needs of the academic community. BCL therefore aims to provide a variety of resources, which support and extend the teaching and research programmes of the University of Guyana. It is hoped that the extramural function of the library will develop as the library progresses.
