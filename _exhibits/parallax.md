From the years 1831 to 1928 the Law Making Body of British Guiana was the Court of Policy. The Court of Policy consisted of the Governor, seven official members and eight elected members. The Governor presided in the Court of Policy as its President.

In 1928 a new Constitution was introduced and British Guiana became a British Crown Colony. A Legislative Council was established and replaced the Dutch created Court of Policy.
In 1953 a new Constitution was promulgated and a bicameral legislature, consisting of a State Council and a House of Assembly was introduced. The State Council consisted of nine members.
